Crochet Mode is here to teach people to crochet or to expand a persons knowledge of crochet. In light of this we are not targeting one specific age group but anyone who is interested in crochet as a new hobby, advancing their hobby, or even a parent who wants to improve their hilds motor skills development. Having simple, uniformed templates throught our pages will make Crochet Mode easy to navigate and understand. The main design draw to Crochet Mode is the specific pattern pages where a user will be able to see a list of the items needed for the pattern, tutorials for the stitches involved in the pattern, and written out directions on how to complete the pattern. By including all of these elements on a specific pattern page we are providing all of the information any user could need in one place, eliminating the need for a user to pull up a secondary site to learn how to make a specific stitch and then need to go pack to the pattern on the first site. If a person decides to sign up as a member they will also be able to favorite specific patterns so they can return to them later on.
