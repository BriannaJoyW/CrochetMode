# CrochetMode
Crochet Mode is a web application specifically designed to make the process of learning to 
crochet simple. There is a plethora of sources for learning how to crochet but they are spread 
across multiple websites. This can make learning how to crochet frustrating to a newcomer as 
they would need to search for a beginner pattern then search for tutorials on each type of stitch 
that the pattern calls for before they can begin crocheting. This process is often overwhelming 
for a beginner as there is so much information to sort through to find what they need. Crochet 
Mode has everything in one place, making it a one stop location for a beginner to get the 
information they need. A simple design makes this web application easy for anyone of any age to 
navigate. Whether you are looking for a new hobby or a way to increase your childâ€™s motor 
skills, Crochet Mode is an essential tool for the learning process. For example, if a recently 
retired woman in the age range of 60 to 80 wanted to learn to crochet they would most likely be 
overwhelmed by how much information is available to them on Pinterest or YouTube. Crochet 
Mode would have tags in place so it would come up on a basic Google search for how to learn to 
crochet. If the retired person decided to Google how to crochet they would find our web 
application and be relieved at not having to search anymore as they would have all of the 
information they needed at Crochet Mode. They could use the navigation to find the patterns 
page and have all of the materials and stitches information as well as videos to teach them how to 
do those stitches. This is also the ideal set up for a parent trying to teach their child how to 
crochet as a way to improve their motor skills. The parent could find a simple scarf pattern and 
either teach themselves how to crochet so that they can then teach their child or supervise their 
child while having the chosen pattern or tutorial displayed for them on the screen. While on our 
web application you can navigate to a Patterns, Tutorials, or Tips & Tricks page depending on 
what you searching for. When you visit the patterns page and select a pattern you will be brought 
to a page with the materials and stitches listed clearly, tutorials for all of the stitches involved in 
the pattern, and simple step by step directions to follow on how to complete the pattern. The set 
up of these pattern pages make it easy to learn as everything you need to know is on a single 
page, eliminating the need for a multi-site search.
